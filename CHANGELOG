3.4:
  * Add MoveFromEdge* actions corresponding to MoveToEdge* but aligns far
    edges instead of near edges, so if you have two overlapping windows you
    can easily put them side by side.
  * (xinerama) Make all placement strategies place windows on the screen with
    the mouse pointer, not just UnderMouse.
  * Fixed several bugs, including the hanging of X when time is set backwards.
  * Changed theme format to xml.

3.3.1:
  * Fix panels getting a border with keepBorder turned on.
  * Fix a crash in mirrorhorizontal when drawing a surface with width 1.

3.3:
  * Add a showDelay option for the dock.
  * Fixed onscreen-keeping code which broke a bit in -rc2.
  * Fix incorrect handling of window properties on 64 bit arches.
  * Fix pixelsize being the same as size for pango, now it is correct.
  * Fix drawing of icons taller than wide, eg gimp.
  * Add a 'mirrorhorizontal' gradient, like horizontal but mirrored in the
    center and 'splitvertical' which is like vertical but nonlinear in a fancy
    way.
  * Translations for de, hr and zh_TW added.
  * Add initial per-app settings support.
  * Fix some outstanding issues with 64-bit support.
  * Add an optional delay for displaying submenus so you can move the mouse
    over some entries without flashing each submenu.
  * Plug some minor memleaks and fix minor bugs.
  * Changed algorithm for downscaling window icons.
  * New themes!
  * Disable support for libstartup-notification by default, it doesn't seem
    to work well.
  * Allow disabling of duplicate window numbering by option titleNumber in
    theme section.
  * Add moverelative and resizerelative actions.
  * Option middle for menus that make submenus be centered instead of aligned
    by the top edge to the parent entry.
  * Fix transient (ie dialog) windows being placed offscreen if the parent
    is close to the edge of the screen.

3.3-rc2:
  * Fixed some typos and errors in rc.xsd
  * Add the noStrut option to the dock (to allow maximizing windows over it),
    useful when it is not in the above layer.
  * Fix transparent terminals not updating when using ToggleDecor.
  * Yet more poking at the onscreen-keeping code, should now do the right
    thing always.
  * Add an option to hide disabled buttons instead of showing them as disabled.
  * Hopefully fixed all the remaining pango issues. The new 1.10 release also
    fixes shadows again.
  * I think the lib linking in Makefile.am is right now, please tell me if it
    isn't.
  * Added a finnish translation and some minor updates to others.
  * Fixed configure.ac so --enable-pango doesn't disable pango support or the
    other way around, make enabled be default to get some extra testing.

3.3-rc1:
  * Poked around a bit in the code that keeps windows onscreen, if you
    are using xinerama, please let me know if things are better/worse/same.
  * Add support for pango, disabled by default due to a bug in pango 1.8 that
    breaks shadows, it works fine with 1.6.x though. Poke the pango developers
    here http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169622 if you want this
    to be fixed.
  * Made edge resist and Send/MoveToEdge not hit windows at layers below
    the current one, add option to disable this behaviour.
  * Fixed directional focus not getting trapped in omnipresent windows
  * Fixed focus actions when bound to the mouse, normal focus cycle is always
    linear and directional focus is totally disabled, it makes no sense
    anyway, just move the mouse.
  * Added an option for the raise/lower/raiselower/unshaderaise/shadelower
    options called group that lets you bind stuff to raise/lower the whole
    window group. <action name="raise"><group>yes</group></action>
  * Add various new actions. I haven't updated the web docs yet, but I think
    I managed to get all of them listed in rc.xsd.
  * Bugs 1783, 1812, 1863, 1905, 2005, 1957 fixed.
  * Some translations added. (ca, no, pl, ru, fr)

3.2:
  * Added spanish and swedish translations
  * Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the actual
    number of the desktop
  * Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
  * the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've
    tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally
    anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the
    edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.
  * Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4
  * Added probably too many options and actions
    * ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
      doesn't save it to the config
    * keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you
      toggleDecorations
    * added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
      move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config
      popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or
      Nonpixel (this is the default).
    * Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus along the bottom
      edge, note that the default is true
    * warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is
      to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the
      cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
    * Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you
      change desktops and have followMouse on)
    * Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox,
      firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3
      grid to start in the middle.
  * I think that was everything, have fun
