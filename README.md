## Added Features

  * Add support for graphical icons in title bar: [example](https://raw.github.com/garnetius/steambox/master/screenshots/desktop.png).
    Use `.png` instead of `.xbm` with the same base name for each icon state to load graphical icons.
  * Fix setting virtual desktops layout from `rc.xml`: `setlayout` program no longer needed.
    Desktop layout would be properly updated upon `openbox --restart` after editing the configuration file.
  * Menus can now have configurable vertical and horizontal padding for items, as well as spacing between individual items.
  * Add ability to change border width and color of window [selector](https://raw.github.com/garnetius/steambox/master/screenshots/switch.png).
  * Add support for ethereal window borders: borders that are drawn normally, but are ignored in screen and window resistance calculations.
    Useful with [compositors](https://github.com/garnetius/compton) which implement border opacity.
  * New `keepBorderMaximized` property (override `keepBorder` behavior for maximized windows).
  * New default window [icon](https://github.com/garnetius/openbox/blob/master/data/openbox.png).
  * Proper Title Case for Menu Labels (default English strings only).
  * Proper handling of `MOTIF_WM_HINTS`.
    Useful with [tint2](https://github.com/garnetius/tint2) to save vertical screen space.
  * Many other little fixes and adjustments.
