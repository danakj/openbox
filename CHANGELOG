  * Allow specifying multiple mousebinds in one tag as we already do
    for keybinds (separated by spaces, as "W-Return M-S-F3" for example).
  * Added option rebindOnMappingNotify option, on by default, which
    controls if we update binds when the keyboard layout changes at runtime.
  * The resize action now only considers the part of the client that is onscreen
    for purposes of picking an action to perform.
  * Make desktop actions non-interactive (means you can have more actions bound
    to a key after them, and the dialog disappears on a timer instead of when
    releasing the modifier keys).
  * obxprop is now not pathologically slow when printing very long arrays.
  * Fix menu accelerator underlines sometimes not showing up.
  * Fix so you can click menu entries before the menuHideDelay expires if it's
    a new click.
  * Don't readd the X event fd to the poll set every time we reconfigure.
  * Fix some specialized button bitmaps not loading from the correct files.
    (toggled + pressed or hover would just be the base toggled image).
  * Various small bugfixes.

  * Update Clearlooks theme.
  * Some other small fixes.

3.4.11:
  * Update Hungarian, Japanese, and Latvian translations.
  * Make xdg-autostart use the OPENBOX environment by default, so you can use
    OnlyShowIn=OPENBOX in an autostart .desktop and it will work as expected.
  * Don't close the menu when you hold control and execute something.
  * Fix bug #4503 (Adjust who shows up in the Alt-Tab list using SKIP_TASKBAR).

3.4.10:
  * Improve keyboard navigation in Openbox menus.
  * Add a --root option and a manpage for obxprop.
  * Use a negative value for submenuShowDelay and submenuHideDelay to cause
    an infinite delay.  This means you have to click to show a submenu, rather
    than just hover over it.
  * Improved code for submenu show/hide delay.  Added the submenuHideDelay
    config file option, under the "menu" section.
  * Fixed bug #4464 (Typo in openbox-gnome-session script).
  * Fixed bug #4436 (Focusing a window used to stop focus cycling).

    window.
  * Add _OB_ROLE, _OB_NAME, and _OB_CLASS hints on each window that show the

    the window when it appears.
  * Improve Openbox interoperability with gnome-session >= 2.24.
  * Fixed bug #4040 (Remove desktop hints set by gdm in the openbox-session

    Google Chrome).
  * Make openbox-session to respect the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable.
  * Fixed bug #4344 where borders were given to windows that should not have
    them.
  * Merge the SessionLogout and Exit actions.  They now test if connected to a
    session manager and ask it to exit if so, or simply kill Openbox if not.
  * Further tweaks to the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message handling.  Use the same
    logic for focus-stealing as is used when mapping a new window.
  * Don't go out of our way any more to prevent focus from moving while the
    keyboard is grabbed.
  * Fix openbox-gnome-session when using gnome-session > 2.22.

3.4.8-rc2:
  * Updated translations: Italian, Croatian, Ukrainian.
  * When resizing a window while focus cycling with bar=no, the bar no longer
    reappears.
  * Correctly handle shaped windows using the ShapeInput kind, this is used
    by many composited apps to pass through clicks in their transparent areas.
  * Fix the <monitor> per-app setting.
  * Avoid using anonymous unions.
  * Windows that had their decorations removed by per-app settings were still
    placed as if they still had their decorations.
  * Fix event handling not to ignore events on a window when they have an unmap
    event in the queue, if that unmap event doesn't cause the window to be
    unmanaged.
  * Show the desktop switch on every monitor in xinerama.
  * Fix interpretation of struts in xinerama where the screens have different
    sizes.
  * Add "next" and "prev" as possible <monitor> targets in the moveto and
    resizeto actions.
  * Allow escaping the _ used to mark the shortcut character in menu labels.
    You can now change the (first) _ in a label to __, this will be displayed
    as a single underscore. The rest of the _ in the string will be unaffected,
    so only double the first one.
  * Only replace ~ with the home directory when it is preceded by whitespace or
    is at the start of the string, and when it is followed by a space, slash, or
    the end of the string. This is implemented with GRegex, and so the required
    glib version has been bumped to 2.14.
  * Some other small fixes.

3.4.8-rc1:
  * Updated translations: Basque, Catalan, Turkish, Italian, Spanish, Russian.
  * New translations: Danish, Turkish, Lithuanian.
  * Set the _MOTIF_WM_INFO atom so urxvt uses motif hints for borderless mode.
  * Properly escape the xml used in session files.
  * Correct a 64-bit issue related to comparing timestamps.
  * There is a sneaky sentence right at the end of a big paragraph in the
    wm-spec document that says windows mapping with _NET_WM_USER_TIME=0 should
    not be focused initially, honor this request.
  * When moving a window to another desktop with following on, bring the
    window's helper windows (for example gimp image windows with the toolbox
    set to utility window).
  * Change the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages again, if they originate from the
    app and the window is on another desktop, just set the demands_attention
    flag. If the event came from the user (ie pager/panel), then the window
    is still moved to the current desktop.

3.4.7.2:
  * The system I used to generate the dist tarball didn't have the
    docbook-to-man command so the manpages were empty.

3.4.7.1:
  * Not to be outdone by the cairo team, I introduced a bug in the last release
    which made resizing not give any feedback. This is now fixed.

3.4.7:
  * Fully updated Czech, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, German,
    French, Hungarian, Norwegian, Vietnamese, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish,
    Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese and Portuguese translations
  * Partially updated Spanish translation
  * Add an example of the "force" option for the per-app placement options to
    the default rc.xml file
  * Add a new xdg-autostart script.  This will eventually end up in the PyXDG
    distribution hopefully, but it is included in Openbox for now.  This script
    runs things based on the freedesktop.org autostart specification.  You can
    have it run GNOME, KDE, ROX, or XFCE specific things if you want.  The
    new default system-wide autostart.sh script runs it automatically
  * Update the default menu.xml to include a lot of common apps
  * Fix white font shadows (negative shadowtint)
  * Update the autostart.sh to find gnome-settings-daemon correctly, as the
    GNOME people have moved it to libexec
  * Fix focus possibly getting stolen when using the Focus action
  * Drastically speed up rendering of Vertical and SplitVertical gradients
  * Speed improvements also for Horizonal and Pyramid gradients
  * Add new theme options, menu.overlap.x and menu.overlap.y options, that let
    you independently control the horizontal and vertical position of submenus
  * Change _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages to not change the current desktop, but
    to bring the window to the current desktop instead.  This is the industry
    standard policy
  * Use the pretty new openbox.png icon as the default window icon
  * Allow matching per-application rules to windows by their window type
    (normal, dialog, splash, etc).  The default rc.xml has more details
  * Add new Openbox-themed prompt windows.  Use these prompt windows to ask
    before killing off windows that aren't responding.  This also means we
    don't need to ping every window constantly forever
  * Add a new <prompt> option to the Execute action.  If this is set to a
    string, a dialog will be shown with that string in it and "yes"/"no"
    buttons.  The command to be executed will only be run if the user selects
    "yes" in the dialog
  * Add a new <prompt> option to the Exit action, which is a boolean (not a
    string).  When true, Openbox will show a dialog confirming if you want to
    exit.  The default is to show the prompt
  * Reduce Openbox's memory footprint and speed up rendering through the use
    of a new icon cache, so that Openbox only needs to keep 1 copy of an icon
    when 100 different windows share it
  * Make Openbox menus have the "menu type" hint for compositors to see and use
  * Fix the MoveResizeTo action for negative coords (opposite edges)
  * Fix key bindings getting lost if multiple bindings at the same level could
    not be translated (Fixes VMWare causing Openbox keybindings to stop
    working)
  * Fix the resize popup box for terminal windows with a base size of 0 (show
    the right size values for urxvt terminals)
  * Fix some off-by-one bugs with the edge growing/shrinking code
  * Add new theme options for menu line separators: menu.separator.color,
    menu.separator.width, menu.separator.padding.width,
    menu.separator.padding.height
  * Add xfce-mcs-manager to the default autostart.sh, and run it automatically
    when gnome-settings-daemon is not present to have GTK apps inherit settings
    from the XFCE configuration tools
  * Make the send-to-desktop menu in the client-menu indicate which is the current
    desktop for omnipresent windows, and don't close it if just toggling
    omni-presence when ctrl-clicking
  * Add a new SessionLogout action that logs out through the session manager,
    when running Openbox within a session manager such as within an
    GNOME/Openbox or KDE/Openbox session.  The action includes a <prompt>
    option which is similar to the Exit action's
  * Add a new gdm-control command that lets you control gdm from within an X
    session.  The gdm-control lets you change GDM's behaviour for when you end
    the current session.  For instance, you can tell GDM to reboot, and
    then immediately log out of the current session, and the computer will be
    rebooted
  * Show an information dialog when an error occurs for Openbox, such as when
    the Execute action fails or when XML syntax errors are present in the
    configuration files
  * When making a window very narrow, don't draw buttons to the right of the title
    on top of the ones on its left.

3.4.6.1:
  * Updated Clearlooks theme
  * Add the force="yes/no" option for the per-app settings' <position> tag
  * Raise and focus modal children and their direct parents together, improved
    usability with direct modal transient windows
  * Fix crash when using <raise> for NextWindow and there are no windows
    to move focus to
  * Add the <manageDesktops> option in the rc.xml <menu> section, which toggles
    the "Manage Desktops" section appearing in the combined-client-list-menu
  * Fix for menu headers showing the wrong text
  * Fix for the <focusLast> behavior
  * Treat modal direct children as one window with their parent consistently

3.4.6:
  * Added Basque translation

    Brasilian Portuguese, Norwegian, and Finnish translations
  * New Clearlooks theme, updated by David Barr

    some users)
  * Automatically catch changes to the keyboard map and reconfigure the key
    bindings on the fly
  * Fix focus moving incorrectly sometimes with focus under mouse enabled
  * Make default configuration focus the desktop when you right click
  * Add the <bar> and <raise> options for all window cycling actions, allowing
    you to have your target window temporarily raised above all others, and to
    turn the focus target indicator bar off
  * Improve the LastDesktop action to not remember desktops you skipped across
  * Ignore mouse clicks that are made on override-redirect (unmanaged) windows
  * When opening a menu with a key binding, don't use the key binding to run
    something in the menu
  * Add a <monitor> option for window placement, which gives you the option
    to place new windows on the active monitor, or the monitor where the mouse
    is, instead of on any monitor (for xinerama multihead setups)
  * Add options for placing the window move/resize coordinate popup window in
    a fixed position on screen, rather than relative to the window being
    moved or resized
  * Prevent the dock from auto-hiding completely offscreen if the theme has
    no borders for it
  * New icon
  * Fix race condition when running things that want to grab the keyboard
    (e.g. gnome-panel-control --main-menu)
  * When dialog windows ask to not appear in the taskbar, still give them focus
    in normal ways (fixes new GNOME session logout dialogs)
  * Fix bug with resizing corners on certain parts of the window frame
  * Ping applications to tell when they are running or have become frozen.
    Show a [Not Responding] message in the title bar of windows which are
    frozen.
  * When closing a window which is [Not Responding], kill the window's process
    if it is running on the same machine as Openbox.  Otherwise, just
    disconnect
    the window from the X display.  A second attempt to close a [Not
    Responding]
    window will kill it forcefully (kill -9).
  * Fixes for internal timers
  * Add a <wmclass> option for the execute action's startup-notification.  This
    lets you tell Openbox that the application will map a window with the
    specified class - for applications that do not support startup-notification
    natively.
  * Fix for empty dock taking up space onscreen after a reconfigure
  * Reduce Openbox's additional memory footprint per-window and per-menu
  * Faster horizontal gradient rendering
  * Don't deiconify windows that aren't allowed to be directly iconified on
    restart (eg toolbars), as they can be iconified by other means
  * Improve support for fullscreen windows in xinerama (TwinView) and
    multiple-screen setups

  * Add --exit to exit the currently running openbox instance

3.4.4:
  * Updated Traditional Chinese translation
  * Updated Norwegian translation
  * Fix for MoveToEdge skipping edges sometimes
  * Let you specify the vertical and horizontal padding independently in themes
  * Fix so that if you select an omnipresent window on another desktop in the
    client list menus, it will go to that desktop
  * Make the GrowToEdge action shrink once there is no more room to grow,
    similar to in 3.4.2, but shrinking to edges as well
  * Move the Send To and Layers submenus to the top of the client menu
  * Fix race causing omnipresent windows to lose focus when switching desktops
    very quickly
  * Don't focus new windows on other desktops if they aren't related to the
    currently focused window
  * Add corner resizing areas in the inner client border (Fixes themes such
    as Onyx)
  * New focus stealing prevention that is smart and not intrusive and not
    annoying
  * Revert a small change in 3.4.3 that caused windows to be placed funny in
    Smart placement when there was a dock or something on the side of the
    screen

    action
  * Don't make clicking on dock apps sometimes act like clicking on the root
    window (Don't propogate button events up)
  * Fix a bug introduced in 3.4.3 which caused the Windows key as a modifier
    for bindings to not work properly
  * Let windows skip across monitors in a Xinerama setup when using MoveToEdge
    or Shift-arrow in an interactive move
  * Make move and resize take the dock into account for resistance
  * Raise new windows when it makes sense, when they aren't being focused
  * Change default config to use click events for mouse wheel bindings instead
    of presses

3.4.3:
  * Add Ukrainian translation
  * Updated translations:
    - Japanese, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Estonian, German, Portuguese,
      Vietnamese, Finnish, Czech, Arabic, Spanish, Swedish, French
  * Improve focus fallback - don't fallback to windows you can't focus cycle
    (Alt-Tab) to
  * Don't show the client border for undecorated windows when keepBorder is on,
    just the outer border

    often.  This needs more work still.
  * Don't focus windows that appear under the mouse in mouse-focus mode unless
    underMouse is enabled

    This fixes problems experienced with maximizing vnc windows
  * Don't XUngrabKeyboard unless we need to
  * Correct calculations for the menu header width, so that they are not
    ellisized unnecessarily
  * Advanced support for partial struts.  When you maximize a window it will
    now only use the struts it needs to.  This can greatly improve
    xinerama functionality.
  * Fixes for how the dock is placed in certain positions on screen (off by 1
    errors)
  * New default bindings:
    - don't unshade when clicking on the titlebar
    - raise when unshading with the scrollwheel
    - lower when shading with the scrollwheel
  * Don't show the top resize area in the titlebar when a window is shaded
  * Optimize rendering of window decorations
  * Optimize splitvertical gradients - no more malloc/free during render
  * Let the theme specify all colors for a splitvertical gradient with the new
    .splitTo theme elements
  * Improve decorations for maximized windows.  Don't draw the side borders in
    the titlebar.
  * Don't resist against desklet windows (below layer + skip taskbar)
  * New actions for dynamically adjusting your desktop workspaces:

    icon from their parents
  * Fix Onyx themes - fade out disabled buttons
  * Don't auto-resize windows to fit on screen if they are UserSpecified
    Size or Position
  * Don't activate windows which raise themselves anymore. It was a nice
    thought, but it caused too much problems
  * Rewrite of the actions subsystem
  * Removed deprecated actions:
    - ShowDesktop, UnshowDesktop (Use ToggleShowDesktop)
    - ResizeRelativeVert, ResizeRelativeHorz (Use ResizeRelative)
  * Combined the MoveFromEdge* actions with MoveToEdge* actions, and removed
    the MoveFromEdge* action names.
  * Switch desktops when moving a window and you drag it to the edge of the
    screen (added the <screenEdgeWarpTime> option for this)
  * Add actions to add/remove the last desktop in the client list menus
  * Use startup notification when launching ObConf in the default root menu
  * Remove the desktop switching dialog, as it confuses people and they don't
    know how to turn it off to switch desktops instantly.  Some other
    incarnation may return in the future.
  * Add optional <finalactions> option for NextWindow, PreviousWindow,
    DirectionalFocus*, and DirectionalTarget* actions
  * Don't focus new helper windows unless they are alone in their group.  This
    fixes gucharmap
  * Fancy keyboard window moving:
    - Shift-arrow will move the window to the next edge
    - Control-arrow will move the window by only 1 pixel
    - Arrow will move the window by a larger number of pixels
  * Fancy keyboard window resizing:
    - The first arrow will choose an edge to resize (then you can grow or
      shrink the window on that edge)
    - Hitting an arrow perpendicular to your selected edge will choose a
      different edge to resize
    - Shift-arrow will grow/shrink the window to the next edge
    - Control arrow will grow/shrink the window by only 1 pixel
    - Arrow will grow/shrink the window by a larger number of pixel
  * Timeout when synchronously resizing a window so you can still resize busy
    or dead application windows
  * Let you specify keyboard shortcuts in your root menus with _. Such as
    label="XTe_rm" would make 'r' the shortcut key.
  * Fixes for placing windows with per-app settings:
    - you can now place windows relative to any edge of the screen instead of
      only the top left. (-0 uses the far edge, +0 uses the near edge.  You can
      use --0 and +-0 to specify negative numbers.)
    - fix bug with windows being placed far off-screen occasionally
    - allow you to place windows partially outside of the screen
    - let per-app settings override program-specified positions (but not if it
      is user-specified)
  * Add user-specified margins to the configuration file
  * Fix for transient windows in groups with transient windows of the group
    transients.  That wasn't supposed to be legible.  i.e. 2 group transients
    and 1 direct transient for one of the group transients.
  * Don't include child/parent windows in tests for being occluded or occluding
    other windows, since you can't raise/lower above/below them.  This fixes
    the raiselower action for windows which have children.

    makes the split harder than it was in 3.4.2
  * Don't include debian/ dir in releases
  * Add resize bindings for the edges to the default hardcoded bindings

  * New preferred option for the Execute action is <command> instead of
    <execute> but the old one will still work.
  * Fix for moving windows partially offsceen causing them to jump far away

    partically too

    around in some earlier versions)
  * Grab the server when mapping windows to avoid race conditions in other
    programs (getting MapNotify before you are visible)
  * Handle case gracefully when ConfigureRequent for restacking specifies
    a siblig which we aren't managing
  * Use KeyRelease to run things from Openbox menus, so that the release
    does not go to the focused window (causing the new window to not get
    focus)
  * Add new actions for controlling window decorations:
    - Decorate, Undecorate
  * Fix so that the values for per-app settings are not case sensitive
  * Fix crash with very small windows

    like chroot, until you end the interactive action)
  * Fix for gtk apps trying to get focus - mostly nullify focus stealing
    prevention (Fixes Tilda)
  * Send ConfigureNotify always on ConfigureRequest (Previous emacs fix
    makes this possible now)
  * Fix RelativeResize action for right/bottom edges
  * Remove SCIM from the default autostart.sh - it has caused problems with
    some (buggy) panels, such as pypanel
  * Fix the titlebar changing to non-focused when iconifying a window with
    animation
  * Use the new osd theme hints for the dock, rather than the titlebar hints
  * Fix rare crash when menu is hidden while browsing it
  * End move/resize more cleanly when focus moves during a move/resize
  * Don't focus new windows when browsing a menu or moving/resizing a window,
    just flash the window instead, so that the menu/move/resize doesn't have to
    cancel.

3.4.1:
  * Add Vietnamese translation
  * Add Japanese translation
  * Keep new transient windows from not getting focus when any related window
    has focus already

  * Make on-screen display dialogs (such as the Alt-Tab dialog) appear on the
    active monitor when using Xinerama (a.k.a. TwinView)
  * Fix for window stacking - let you lower sibling transient windows behind
    eachother
  * Fix directional focus actions when used without a dialog
  * Fix race that could prevent ObConf from setting the desktop names correctly
  * Add new theme options:
    - window.active.button.toggled.image.color has been split into:
      - window.active.button.toggled.unpressed.image.color
      - window.active.button.toggled.pressed.image.color
      - window.active.button.toggled.hover.image.color

  * Fix for focus cycling to helper windows - Don't count dialogs as a sibling,
    so they don't stop you
  * Allow the use of negative numbers in per-app settings position to place a
    window relative to the right/bottom edges of your monitor (taking the
    struts (panels) into account)

    window is focused
  * Fixes for frame decorations layout

    if they are a user-specified size (USSize) or if they are non-normal
    windows.  (Fix Rox pinboard mapping across multiple monitors)

  * Give iconified windows a faded icon in the focus cycling (Alt-Tab) dialog,
    and in the client list menus
  * Make it more difficult to select items by accident in parent menus when it

  * Don't let child (transient) windows steal focus when the situation is
    ambiguous
  * Fix bevels and borders display in the titlebar
  * Set the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW hint properly, when nothing is focused (This

    missing RevertToParent case)
  * Fix new frame elements being given 0 sizes for very small windows
  * Send iconified windows to the bottom of the focus order so you can
    Alt-Shift-Tab to get back what you just iconified. This makes things more

    0 in _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages (Rox pinboard)
  * Fixes for default rc.xml configuration file. Updated comments and comment
    out the applications section in an xml compatible way.

    log in.
  * The &lt;desktop&gt; section from the configuration file is only used for
    defaults, and so is only applied at the start of a new log-in. (Use ObConf
    1.6.2 to change the config file for these options, and have them set
    immediately, if you don't use a session manager to save them.)

    with <startupnotify>. It's an option for execute actions.
  * New combined client menu, accessed with
    <action name="ShowMenu"><menu>client-list-combined-menu</menu></action>

    openbox-session command
  * Many code paths made significantly faster
  * Sections of code rewritten to be more reliable, such as session
    save/restore and input focus handling
  * Handle the X server's clock going backwards, without locking up. Sometimes
    the server can still lock up though, it is not recommended to do this!
  * Better handling of window types such as docks, utility windows, tool bar
    windows. Clicking to focus these windows is done more intelligently.  Dock
    windows no longer get focus when you click them, so that you don't have
    focus flickering when you use a dock window with a taskbar.
  * Better language support through Pango, which is now mandatory, and the
    code for Pango has been greatly improved and optimized.
  * Support for windows that use true 32-bit transparency

    - won't steal focus from other screens, and let you focus a screen by
    clicking on the desktop (root window).
  * Support for more cursors through XCursor, means that startup notification
    can use a pointer+watch cursor if you are using an XCursor theme
  * Fully maximize terminal windows (and any resized-by-increment window)
  * Show the hostname of clients running on remote computers in the titlebar
  * Add <panels> and <desktop> options to NextWindow, PreviousWindow,
    DirectionalFocusNorth etc..
  * Synchronize resizing with the application when possible
  * Smarter subdivision of windows into 9 sections for resizing
  * Set default icon on windows so applications can agree on an icon
  * Better support for programs that are on more than one desktop
    (multiple firefox windows for example) - move to the desktop when you're
    using the application and it opens a window on another desktop.
  * Chrooted key chains, and key quoting through chroots
  * New BreakChroot action to break out of the current chroot
  * New keychains popup, to show where you are in a keychain

    VLC
  * Session support for old clients that do not use the session management
    protocol
  * Desktop setup is only changed on startup, so as to not overwrite settings
    from other apps like pagers
  * Take advantage of ksmserver (KDE Session Manager) features
  * KDE/Openbox and GNOME/Openbox options for display manager GDM/KDM. Use
    openbox-gnome-session and openbox-kde-session to run a GNOME or KDE
    session with Openbox as the window manager.
  * Titlebar buttons autohide when hiding won't move other buttons (removed
    the hideDisabled option from config file)
  * Support user time window hint, which is good for laptops power usage
  * When legacy windows raise themselves, interpreate as wanting to be
    activated. Makes Firefox more pleasant.
  * Don't show handles on windows that cant resize for more extreme visual
    minimalism
  * Let you move maximized windows between Xinerama monitors
  * Improve application awareness of focus, e.g. Kopete and Firefox, so they
    know when they are or aren't focused, and which window in their
    application is focused
  * Improvements in the distributed themes
  * Add new Clearlooks and Clearlooks-Olive themes by John McKnight
  * Fonts are no longer loaded from theme. They are loaded from the rc.xml
    config file. Font shadow settings are still loaded from the theme though.

    OnScreenDisplay

    properties when you didnt mean to)
  * window.inactive.border.color   (note that globbing might set these
    properties when you didnt mean to)

    (button masks) will be centered
  * Default titlebar button icons (as xbms) installed to /usr/share/doc/openbox
  * New mouse binding contexts Left, Right, TLCorner, TRCorner and Top. These
    need bindings in config file to be useful. Also new context Bottom which
    is synonym for Handle.
  * W is no longer hard coded to Mod4. It is now a shortcut for Super, which
    is usually bound to Mod4. xmodmap will show your mapping.
  * The per-app setting <head> has been renamed to <monitor>
  * Can use "default" for anything in per-app settings

  * Fix pixelsize being the same as size for pango, now it is correct.
  * Fix drawing of icons taller than wide, eg gimp.
  * Add a 'mirrorhorizontal' gradient, like horizontal but mirrored in the
    center and 'splitvertical' which is like vertical but nonlinear in a fancy
    way.
  * Translations for de, hr and zh_TW added.
  * Add initial per-app settings support.
  * Fix some outstanding issues with 64-bit support.
  * Add an optional delay for displaying submenus so you can move the mouse
    over some entries without flashing each submenu.
  * Plug some minor memleaks and fix minor bugs.
  * Changed algorithm for downscaling window icons.
  * New themes!
  * Disable support for libstartup-notification by default, it doesn't seem
    to work well.
  * Allow disabling of duplicate window numbering by option titleNumber in
    theme section.
  * Add moverelative and resizerelative actions.
  * Option middle for menus that make submenus be centered instead of aligned
    by the top edge to the parent entry.
  * Fix transient (ie dialog) windows being placed offscreen if the parent
    is close to the edge of the screen.

3.3-rc2:
  * Fixed some typos and errors in rc.xsd
  * Add the noStrut option to the dock (to allow maximizing windows over it),
    useful when it is not in the above layer.
  * Fix transparent terminals not updating when using ToggleDecor.
  * Yet more poking at the onscreen-keeping code, should now do the right
    thing always.
  * Add an option to hide disabled buttons instead of showing them as disabled.
  * Hopefully fixed all the remaining pango issues. The new 1.10 release also
    fixes shadows again.
  * I think the lib linking in Makefile.am is right now, please tell me if it
    isn't.
  * Added a finnish translation and some minor updates to others.
  * Fixed configure.ac so --enable-pango doesn't disable pango support or the
    other way around, make enabled be default to get some extra testing.

3.3-rc1:
  * Poked around a bit in the code that keeps windows onscreen, if you
    are using xinerama, please let me know if things are better/worse/same.
  * Add support for pango, disabled by default due to a bug in pango 1.8 that
    breaks shadows, it works fine with 1.6.x though. Poke the pango developers
    here http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=169622 if you want this
    to be fixed.
  * Made edge resist and Send/MoveToEdge not hit windows at layers below
    the current one, add option to disable this behaviour.
  * Fixed directional focus not getting trapped in omnipresent windows
  * Fixed focus actions when bound to the mouse, normal focus cycle is always
    linear and directional focus is totally disabled, it makes no sense
    anyway, just move the mouse.
  * Added an option for the raise/lower/raiselower/unshaderaise/shadelower
    options called group that lets you bind stuff to raise/lower the whole
    window group. <action name="raise"><group>yes</group></action>
  * Add various new actions. I haven't updated the web docs yet, but I think
    I managed to get all of them listed in rc.xsd.
  * Bugs 1783, 1812, 1863, 1905, 2005, 1957 fixed.
  * Some translations added. (ca, no, pl, ru, fr)

3.2:
  * Added spanish and swedish translations
  * Changed "Unnamed Desktop" to "Desktop n" where n is the actual
    number of the desktop
  * Hopefully no more of the hanging X totally bug
  * the fullscreen property now overrides aspect hints, all programs i've
    tried that use it (mplayer and tvtime) handle the aspect internally
    anyway, this just makes sure you have black borders all the way to the
    edge. If this breaks anything for you, let me know.
  * Added M as an alias for Mod3 in the same manner that W is an alias for Mod4
  * Added probably too many options and actions
    * ToggleDockAutohide to toggle the autohide option at runtime,
      doesn't save it to the config
    * keepBorder option to set if you want the 1-pixel border when you
      toggleDecorations
    * added popupShow and popupPosition to control where and when the
      move/resize-popup is shown, these go in the resize section of the config
      popupPosition can be Top or Center, popupShow can be Always, Never or
      Nonpixel (this is the default).
    * Added the xorStyle option to change the behaviour of menus along the bottom
      edge, note that the default is true
    * warpPointer option in the menu section to control if the mouse cursor is
      to be warped by openbox when the menu moves to keep on screen to keep the
      cursor in the same place relative to the menu. (I think i got that right)
    * Added back the focusLast option (this controls what happens when you
      change desktops and have followMouse on)
    * Added an option to set which desktop to start on when you start openbox,
      firstdesk, for example you might like to set it to 5 if you have a 3x3
      grid to start in the middle.
  * I think that was everything, have fun
