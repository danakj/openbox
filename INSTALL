Installation instructions for Openbox:

Compilation and Installation:
--------------------------------
   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory in the
Openbox source tree.

Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run
in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile Openbox, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to bhughes@tcac.net so they can be considered
for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache' contains
results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'. 


Compilers and Options:
----------------------
   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure


Optional Features:
------------------
Openbox supports the XShape extension of X11R6.  This support is enabled by
default, but may be overridden by specifying `--disable-shape' on the configure
script's command line.

Openbox supports Window Maker dockapps (warning: restarts from wmaker to
Openbox don't always handle dockapps correctly) with a gadget called the Slit.
The Slit is compiled into Openbox by default, but may be overridden by
specifying `--disable-slit' on the configure script's command line.

Openbox supports a rendering effect called "faked interlacing" which darkens
every other line in rendered images.  This support works only for gradient
images.  It is compiled in by default, but may be overridden by specifying
`--disable-interlace' on the configure script's command line. 

Openbox provides an alternative rendering algorithm for dithering on
pseudocolor (8 bit) displays. A noticeable pattern is visible when using
this; it's a matter of taste whether this looks better than the default
algorithm. It is disabled by default, but may be overridden by specifying
'--enable-ordered-pseudo' on the configure script's command line.

Openbox uses a timer which allows it to periodically flush its pixmap
cache. It is enabled by default, but may be overridden by specifying
'--disable-timed-cache' on the configure script's command line.

Also, `configure' can usually find the X include and library files
automatically, but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure'
options `--x-includes=DIR' and `--x-libraries=DIR' to specify
their locations.
